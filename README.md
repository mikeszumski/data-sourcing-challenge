# retrieve_movie_data - Module 6 Challenge
The aim of this challenge is to prepare some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. We will source reviews data from The New York Times API and we will collect details about the movies from The Movie Database  Finally, we'll merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.

## Source
All code is based on templates provided, and is my work.

## Where is the code?
The code module, retrieve_movie_data.ipynb, is in the top level folder of my "data-sourcing-challenge" repo.
The output of the program is stored in moviesandreviews.csv, and is also found in the top level of this repo.
